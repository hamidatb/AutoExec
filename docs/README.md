# AutoExec - AI Agent for Student Organization Management

Hi there! I'm Hamidat, and I built **AutoExec** to solve a real problem I experienced as a student leader. Managing multiple clubs and organizations was overwhelming - tracking meeting minutes, following up on action items, and ensuring deadlines were met was becoming a full-time job. So I created an AI agent that automates the entire workflow.

## üéØ What Problem Does AutoExec Solve?

As a student leader, I found myself constantly:
- Manually parsing meeting minutes for action items
- Tracking dozens of tasks across multiple team members
- Sending reminder after reminder for overdue assignments
- Coordinating meeting schedules and attendance
- Managing Google Drive documents and spreadsheets

**AutoExec significantly reduces this manual work** by using AI to understand natural language, automatically extract tasks from meeting minutes, and intelligently manage the student organization workflow.

## üöÄ Current Features (In Production)

### **AI Agent Task Management**

- **Intelligent Task Assignment**: The bot automatically assigns tasks based on context and team member availability

### **Automated Meeting Management**
- **Smart Scheduling**: `/meeting set` command with natural language parsing
- **Automatic Reminders**: T-2h, T-0, and T+30m notifications

#### **Meeting Management (Natural Language)**
```bash
# Just talk to the bot naturally!
@AutoExec "Schedule a weekly team meeting for tomorrow at 5pm"
@AutoExec "When is our next meeting?"
@AutoExec "Create an agenda for our project review meeting"
@AutoExec "Show me all upcoming meetings"
```

#### **Task Management (Natural Language)**
```bash
# Just talk to the bot naturally!
@AutoExec "Create a task for John to prepare presentation slides due tomorrow"
@AutoExec "What tasks do I have?"
@AutoExec "Mark my budget review task as done"
@AutoExec "Reschedule my meeting prep to next Friday"
```

#### **Natural Language Responses**
When the bot pings you about a task, you can reply however you want - just use natural language!

## üí° Why I Built This

As a computer science student and active club leader, I saw firsthand how much time student organizations waste on administrative tasks. Traditional project management tools like Trello or Asana weren't designed for the unique needs of student groups - they're too complex, too expensive, and don't integrate with the tools students actually use (Discord, Google Drive).

I wanted to create something that:
- **Just works** without complex setup or training
- **Integrates seamlessly** with existing student workflows
- **Scales automatically** as organizations grow
- **Leverages AI** to eliminate manual work
- **Remains free** for student organizations
